# Thermocapillary thin films: periodic steady states and film rupture

In this repository you find the Matlab code that has generated the numerical plots used in the article "Thermocapillary thin films: periodic steady states and film rupture" by Gabriele Bruell, Bastian Hilder and Jonas Jansen. The journal version is available open-access at [DOI:10.1088/1361-6544/ad2a8a](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6544/ad2a8a) and a preprint can be found at [arXiv:2308.11279](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11279).

### Abstract

We study stationary, periodic solutions to the thermocapillary thin-film model $$\partial_t h + \partial_x \Bigl(h^3(\partial_x^3 h - g\partial_x h) + M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\partial_xh\Bigr) = 0,\quad t>0,\ x\in \mathbb{R},$$ which can be derived from the BÃ©nard--Marangoni problem via a lubrication approximation. When the Marangoni number $M$ increases beyond a critical value $M^*$, the constant solution becomes spectrally unstable via a (conserved) long-wave instability and periodic stationary solutions bifurcate. For a fixed period, we find that these solutions lie on a global bifurcation curve of stationary, periodic solutions with a fixed wave number and mass. Furthermore, we show that the stationary periodic solutions on the global bifurcation branch converge to a weak stationary periodic solution which exhibits film rupture. The proofs rely on a Hamiltonian formulation of the stationary problem and the use of analytic global bifurcation theory. Finally, we show the instability of the bifurcating solutions close to the bifurcation point and give a formal derivation of the amplitude equation governing the dynamics close to the onset of instability. 

### pde2path

The data was obtained using the Matlab library [pde2path](https://www.staff.uni-oldenburg.de/hannes.uecker/pde2path/index.html). 

### Instructions

After installing and initializing pde2path, the data is generated by running cmds.m in Matlab. 
There are two implemented ways to save the generated data (by default, both are turned off):
- Changing 'saveFigures' to 1 in cmds.m saves the Matlab-figures of the bifurcation diagram as well as the plots of to solutions (one close to the onset of bifurcation and one close to film rupture) as eps-files. 
- Changing 'saveData' to 1 in cmds.m writes the data points for the bifurcation diagram and the solution graphs to a txt-fille.
